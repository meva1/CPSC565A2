CPSC 565 Assignment 2

UNITY VERSION 2020.2.0f1

#Introduction

This project models the game of quidditch. The snitch moves around the play area randomly while the players move due to forces attracting or repelling them from the snitch, other players, and play area boundaries. A point is awarded each time a team's player collides with the snitch and an additional point is awarded if that team also scored the last point.
